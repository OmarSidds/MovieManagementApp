# Movie Management App

### By Omar Siddiqui

## Project Outline 

This app is made using Object Oriented Priciples to save and view movies you have watched as objects with vlaues like: title, genre, year released, watched(true/false).



## Features

* Programmed application following Object-Oriented Programming principles. Movie objects have values of: title, genre, year 
released, watched(true/false). 
* Use of three different classes(Movie, Movie Manager, Movie Management), to apply encapsulation, separating data and 
behavior from outside code and promote modularity by breaking down the app into smaller, more manageable parts.
* Applications contains implementation of polymorphism by having the toString() method overridden to return a string more 
suited for the application
